# GuessGame
A guessing game written in Java. The program randomly chooses a number between 1 and 1000 and the user enters guesses until he or she guesses the correct number. After each guess, the program gives feedback (too high or too low), and the window turns red if the guess is "warmer" (closer than the last guess) or blue if it's "colder" (further than the last guess).
